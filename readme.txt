Plugin for recording users IP. 

== Description ==

This is simple yet useful plug-in to keep and record users IPs on login time. If your site has membership 
feature and you need to have close control on users behavior then this plug-in may come handy as it really is for me!

== Installation ==

1. Upload `WP Record IP` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress. This will put a sub-menu under Users menu that points to
   logs page.
3. Enjoy!
